# HTML Elements Guided Activity

Welcome!
This activity will help you practice **block vs inline elements**, **media (audio & video)**, **graphics (img, svg, canvas)**, and **iframes** in HTML.  

Follow the steps carefully and commit your progress after each section.

---

## Learning Goals
- Understand the difference between **block** and **inline** elements.  
- Use **media elements** to add audio and video.  
- Create **graphics** with `<img>`, `<svg>`, and `<canvas>`.  
- Embed external content using an `<iframe>`.  

---

## Part 1: Block vs Inline Elements
1. Create a file called `block-inline.html`.  
2. Add a **paragraph (`<p>`)** with some text. Inside it, place:  
   - A **`<strong>`** word (inline element).  
   - A **`<span>`** with a different background color.  
3. Add two **block elements** (`<div>` and `<section>`) and give them borders to see how they stack.

## Part 2: Media (Audio & Video)
1. Create a file called `media.html`.  
2. Add:  
   - An **audio player** using `<audio controls>` with an MP3 file.  
   - A **video player** using `<video controls width="320">` with an MP4 file.  
3. Add a **track** (`<track>`) to your video for captions.  
  

---

## Part 3: Graphics (Image, SVG, Canvas)
1. Create a file called `graphics.html`.  
2. Add:  
   - An `<img>` showing any image (local or online).  
   - An inline **SVG circle**
   - A **canvas** and draw a rectangle inside it using JavaScript
     

---

## Part 4: iFrame
1. Create a file called `child.html` in your project folder.  
   - Add a heading, a short paragraph, and optionally an image to make it look like a simple webpage.  

2. Create another file called `iframe.html`.  
   - Inside it, use an `<iframe>` to embed your `child.html` page.  
   - Give the iframe a width, height, and a border so you can clearly see it on the page.
